# py-example

This repo is a modified version of code project created by the `generator-py` for Yeoman [https://github.com/kaelzhang/generator-py](https://github.com/kaelzhang/generator-py).

To get started it is first recommended to create a python virtual environment.

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then run `make install`.

In Visual Studio Code unit tests should be auto discovered as well as linting and intellisense.

## TODO

- Fix `Dockerfile`
- Fix `docs`
